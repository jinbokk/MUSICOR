## Lessons Learned

I have learned the following during this project:

* I learned the usage of the Client Credential flow in the OAuth 2.0 protocol to securely retrieve data from a server in a simplified manner.

* I learned how to create dynamic animations easily by utilizing scroll events and the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) library.

* I learned how to use the Lighthouse extension for Chrome browser to analyze the level of optimization of a website and quantify it. Through this process, I optimized the network resources by converting high-resolution images into lower-resolution ones, based on the analysis provided by Lighthouse.
